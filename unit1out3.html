<h6>
    Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.  Could you have been more efficient when making your website?  How?  Could you have done it in teams?
</h6>
<p>
    Benefits: In my opinion, the whole experience has provided three weeks of something exciting, positive and challenging to look forward to each day and despite it being a fairly big learning curve, I have loved every second of the course and would happily go through it all again in the blink of an eye; its left me eager for more!  I have found the use of Visual Studio Code inspirational and really useful.  It is a great piece of IT software for taking the ideas you have formed in your head and bringing them to life through multiple lines of code.  Things that could otherwise only be imagined and rarely realised.  It’s quite easy to get used to using it and the layout is uncomplicated.  The way it works with different types of code simultaneously and in harmony with other external developer software appears pretty much seamless; as I’m sure it was intended.
    <br><br>
    Drawbacks:  The single drawback I can think of whilst using these different platforms, would be, not having the immediate technical skills to implement them to their full advantage, but that’s more about my own skill level and less about them I suppose.  GitHub was quite difficult to get used to at first, but once I’d familiarised myself with the specific ways to push and pull files, I was impressed with its ability to store and transfer code and other file types easily.  I do believe these types of software can affect the degree of output a person or team is/are able to achieve when in the wrong hands though, thus productivity and efficiency is hampered somewhat.  That said (like most new things) once the user has become established with the layout and functions of a piece of software, it is highly possible to create great code and the products that become of doing so (e.g., websites).

    Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.
</h6>
<p>
    Take regular short breaks, so as to rest your eyes from staring at the computer screen for too long.  Stretch quite frequently and stand up to do so, if possible.  Take advantage of any Yoga classes that are made available during your working week, as these will reset your body and mind and keep your focus where it matters most.
    <br><br>
    Decent time management is always really important, as is the ability to concentrate under pressure, so being able to cope with those kinds of things is a big advantage.  If working as part of a team, remember to communicate effectively.  Unfortunately, when there are members in the team that find this hard to do, it can heavily delay or entirely halt the working process if things aren’t addressed soon enough.
    <br><br>
    Be proactive within your learning of developer coding and take the attitude that it is always an extremely good idea to continue honing your own personal coding skillset… in fact, never stop!  It’ll hopefully make you a more efficient and adaptable coding expert in time to come and therefore more employable too.
    <br><br>
    Oh and in my case, plus not forgetting to mention... get more sleep overnight between each session of coding.  It’s absolutely imperative to get a sensible amount of rest or else your work rate and concentration can falter considerably and the project will suffer because of this as well.

    Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.  What would you do differently next time?  Team work?  Use of Slack?
</h6>
<p>
    By using a mind-map to think through and design the overall architecture of a website build, I think it would allow for clearer direction and visualisation of the final site structure and content.  Trying out a different method of file sharing as a back-up option to GitHub and seeing if there are perhaps better alternatives available.  I did use Slack and found it was really worth using to upload my graphics and photos whilst simultaneously keeping a log of my activity and progress alongside Trello; in case something happened to get missed and halt the workflow whilst resolving the issue.
    <br><br>
    I was more than happy to work alone on this website, but I wouldn’t be averse at all to working in a team towards a website project either.  The workload would be spread amongst several people in a team though, so I imagine this could be quite helpful when dealing with the productivity side of the project.  Although, it would mean less involvement with the overall site content and appearance and instead, more specific areas to be dealt with.  This could be a better or worse approach, all depending on the type of person you are and how you prefer to work towards gaining end results.

    Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.
</h6>
<p>
    I think the best way to test a digital project (when coding) is to do just that, test it!  Look through it all carefully, go through the code with a keen eye for detail and look for obvious errors (if any) and if there are some to be found, correct them and repeat the process, but this time look for the far less obvious mistakes… “the devil is in the detail” as the saying goes.  This can potentially make the absolute world of difference between a test ‘success’ and test ‘failure’.  Make sure you constantly and exhaustively review the outcomes of your code (if building a website, for example) and do this in the different browsers available; to name a few: Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
