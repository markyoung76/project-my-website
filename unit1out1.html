    Start by writing an ‘about me’ section about your background, why you decided to come to Code Nation and about your experience so far.
</h6>
<p>
    Welcome to all of you fellow coders and/or those who have arrived at my Code Nation website project.  I’m Mark… hey there!  So, how are you finding the, ‘Develop: Coding’ course so far?
    <br>
    Upon almost reaching the end of my own 3-week cohort experience, I can genuinely say I have been engrossed and inspired by all it has provided me.  Firstly, let me just say, what an amazing opportunity this place offers people from all walks of life they’ve previously led!
    <br>
    In my personal life, I have definitely had to rise to new and exciting challenges in my past; anything from being an officer for Her Majesty’s prison service, to studying for a BA Hons degree in my early 30’s as a mature student, even after having been out of any kind of academic surrounding for almost 15+ years prior to that point.  Despite now being 40 (ish) years ‘young’ on this awesome planet, I actually feel within my prime and in more ways than one, I’m metaphorically turning the corner a full 90 degrees as I write these words.
    <br>
    I’m lucky enough to have found Code Nation when I least expected it (that’s often the best way for it to happen so they say) and it is my hope to completely retrain in coding and cyber security to allow me to endeavour towards an entirely new and exciting career… even at my age!
    <br>
    I’m a fiercely proud father to one awesome 10 year old Son called Connor and he’s my little hero.  As most decent parents will suggest, it’s always paramount to become your child’s positive role-model wherever possible and I hope to make him equally proud of me too.  This was just my first step on the coding ladder (having never really properly coded before, although I did have a small amount of knowledge on the subject before commencing).
    <br>
    Here’s to the future!  Good luck to you all and get the very best from your time, it’ll undoubtedly pay dividends in the long run.

    Describe the purpose of IT in modern business.
</h6>
<p>
    It is extremely hard to imagine how we would have reached the current levels of technological superiority we appear to have accomplished within the past 50 to 100 years, if it wasn’t for the inventors of things that help to make life run more effectively and efficiently.  To name but a few, we owe a huge debt of gratitude and appreciation to inventors of the steam engine, electricity, telecommunications, fibre-optics, the Internet, plus other amazing and forward-looking inventions that have assisted us to continue making leaps in to newer technologies over more recent years.
    <br>
    IT has a massive impact on modern businesses.  On the surface, we see cars being built by robotic equipment, contactless payment systems or things like real-time video conversations being enabled to occur across the globe, from the comfort of our on home.  That said, underneath the surface, modern businesses can usually gain a return on investment (ROI) for taking measures that allow IT to speed up otherwise costly and time-consuming production methods; which can increase profitability over time.
    <br>
    IT, when placed in the right expert and/or capable hands, makes for streamlining the professional workflow.  It can also heavily influence the direction in which a company heads; positive information technology can build success, whereas outdated IT can potentially cause considerable issues for the workforce and possibly bring about the downfall of a business, if it doesn’t resolve the problem soon enough.  IT has a huge place in modern businesses, it can help to alleviate or eliminate rudimentary issues by assisting and problem-solving a way out of business dilemmas and can give a considerable advantage to those who make wise use it.
