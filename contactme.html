    As well as my continued interest in professional developer roles and coding in general, I also have a gargantuan life-long passion for anything creative (both visual & audio) and the following is an optional audio file that was composed by me specifically for its use within this website project.  It can be played prior to or after viewing the content if so desired or ignored altogether if not.  Although, If you've got a few minutes to spare, it only lasts 4 minutes 20 seconds and should playback just once, unless requested again.  I particularly chose not to embed it in to the background of the HTML code, because I personally don't enjoy visiting sites that insist on you listening to the music that's provided against your will, without any user control whatsoever (e.g., auto-start of audio playback upon page-load).  I have also included a screenshot from Apple's Garageband application, showing the mixer window of the tracks that produced this instrumental piece of music.  I have named it, "Just Around The Bend":
