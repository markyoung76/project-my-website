<ul> 
        <li>Create structures and styles for a webpage.</li>
        <br>
        <li>You are setting up as an independent consultant, which is very exciting, however, you’re going to need a website of your own to highlight your skills, availability and areas of work.  It’s time for you to create a website that details you, includes pages/sections and a how you built it page.</li>

    Describe the content and layout for each page.

<p>
    I divided my web-pages in to the sections and subsections that directly reflected the project outcomes and followed this approach on every page to give a consistent appearance.  I found they were best shown as a website button for each part of the project I was relating the answers to.  The colour scheme consists of, blue, orange and purple; the theme is based around my own company branding logo, ‘youngocreate’.  This logo appears as a small version of the logo in the top left corner of each page and also as a larger and transparent ‘watermark’ behind the text on all of the pages.  I thought this would make a visually impacting website for the visitor/end-user.
    <br><br>
    Other than the page for, ‘unit 2 outcome 1’ the overall appearance is standardised across the whole site.  This structure included making the heading and subheading titles central to the page and positioning them in exactly the same place throughout, whilst giving the outcome headings a lighter colour and left-hand side alignment.  Any further headers were made slightly smaller and different in colour to allow the to be distinguished from other areas of the page and along with the main body text, I coded floating panels in a translucent blue gradients behind the writing to make them stand out better.  The only difference with, ‘unit 2 outcome 1’ is that it has the inclusion of the example browser screenshots towards the bottom of the page (as required by the project brief).
    <br><br>
    On my, ‘contact me’ page, I included both an email and social media link and a fun piece of music that I had created especially for the website, called, “Just Around The Bend (remix)”.  I coded the alignment of the audio player to feature centrally below the links and made sure I also included some user controls like, a volume slider and a skip forwards/backwards 15 seconds option, as well as the necessary play/pause button.
