<ul> 
    <li>Create structures and styles for a webpage.</li>

    <li>You are setting up as an independent consultant, which is very exciting, however, you’re going to need a website of your own to highlight your skills, availability and areas of work.  It’s time for you to create a website that details you, includes pages/sections and a how you built it page.</li>

<h6>
    Describe the content and layout for each page.
</h6>
<p>
    I divided my web-pages in to the sections and subsections that directly reflected the project outcomes and followed this approach on every page to give a consistent appearance.  I found they were best shown as a website button for each part of the project I was relating the answers to.  The colour scheme consists of, blue, orange and purple; the theme is based around my own company brand logo, ‘youngocreate’.  This logo appears as a small version of the logo in the top left corner of each page and also as a larger and transparent ‘watermark’ behind the text on all of the pages.  I thought this would make a visually impacting website for the visitor/end-user.
    <br><br>
    Other than the page for, ‘unit 2 outcome 1’ the overall appearance is standardised across the whole site.  This structure included making the heading and subheading titles central to the page and positioning them in exactly the same place throughout, whilst giving the outcome headings a lighter colour and left-hand side alignment.  Any further headers were made slightly smaller and different in colour to allow them to be distinguished from other areas of the page and along with the main body text, I coded floating panels in a translucent blue gradients behind the writing to make them stand out better.  The only difference with, ‘unit 2 outcome 1’ is that it has the inclusion of the example browser screenshots towards the bottom of the page (as required by the project brief).
    <br><br>
    On my, ‘contact me’ page, I included both an email and social media link and a fun piece of music that I had created especially for the website, called, “Just Around The Bend (remix)”.  I coded the alignment of the audio player to feature centrally below the links and made sure I also included some user controls like, a volume slider and a skip forwards/backwards 15 seconds option, as well as the necessary play/pause button.

    Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites.
</h6>
<p>
    Copyright is a safeguarding method that can (and should) be used for those that wish to retain intellectual property rights and protection for the personal or business material they have uploaded to the World Wide Web.  Automatically and by default a persons work gains copyright protection and this therefore saves them from having to make any form of application to achieve this status.
    <br><br>
    If a personal user or business commits their material to the Internet for others to view, enjoy and/or make use of, it gives them peace of mind to know that their work isn’t able to be unfairly and illegally stolen, to be used elsewhere.
    <br><br>
    A copyright symbol © does not have to be attached to the website, because this will not affect the degree of protection that is given to the work, although, a visual reminder/warning can be offered to the visiting public that use the given website, to inform them that any infringement of this copyright protection, can (and will) most likely lead to prosecution of that individual or group.
    <br><br>
    Digital content including; original logos, photos, illustrations/graphics, music/audio, original literary and non-literary written work (e.g., software, web content, databases), etc, are all protected by this legal method.

    Describe access issues that need taking into account.  Also, describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.
</h6>
<p>
    Accessibility is really important if a website developer or group wish to make their webpages legible for more than just one type of end-user.  For example, people with visually impaired sight can sometimes struggle to decipher certain colours; whether that be on their own or a colour on top of another colour.  Certain font-families (including the size that is used) offer a far clearer and visually acceptable appearance when including any written content within a website; whereas others can be almost intolerable and impossible to read (even for people with 20/20 vision).  Clarity of the content is also important, using abbreviations and/or jargon unnecessarily or without clear explanation(s) being attached to the written statement can easily put a person off of wanting to visit the website.  The, ‘text-to-speech’ functionality built-in to most modern computers (Apple and PC) can be really helpful for people with sight disabilities.  This can usually assist and often completely rectify the problems they might face whilst attempting to read text contained within a webpage.  Making a site easy to navigate will also considerably help people with learning difficulties; by not over-complicating the layout of a page design/website, it makes for a much more user-friendly and welcoming user-experience (otherwise known as, UI and UX).

    Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.
</h6>
<p>
    There are dozens of file types that are and aren’t appropriate for use within a website; it can be a bit of a minefield at first.  However, webpages are generally able to include and operate successfully using the majority of different file extensions available, but sometimes certain situations require a particular file type over another.  An example of a reason for this would be where an HTML page needs to create a specific look or appearance; e.g., a .jpeg image will not usually allow for a transparent background to be had, therefore the user will normally see a solid background (possibly white) surrounding the image.  This can detract from the appearance the web-build developer was hoping to achieve and thus, a different file type would need to be acquired to deliver the desired effect.  By using a .png file this problem would be resolved in most, if not all circumstances.  This same requirement is also necessary when using audio file types to gain the best outcome in a similar scenario.  The compression of certain file types can also be a good or bad thing depending on what is needed for a particular section of a webpage.  When using .jpeg files it is wise to remember that although the speed of webpage upload can normally be increased, the quality can often be diminished, whereas .png and occasionally .gif file formats may slow things down slightly, but (on the whole) offer a better image quality.
