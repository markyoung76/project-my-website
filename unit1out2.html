    Outcome 2:
</h4>
<ul> 
        <li>Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Now you have setup your blog, it’s time to get into the detail.  You now need to critically review your website.  To the bottom of your website add a review section that contains the following information.</li>
</ul>
    </div>
    <div>
<h5>
    2.1
</h5>
<h6>
    Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed.  In making your own website are you happy with the tools you used?  E.g., Visual Studio Code, Trello.
</h6>
<p>
    I’m coming to the point where my website feels almost complete (for the benefit of the project requirements) and in review of the IT tools I have used during the building of it, I can safely say I have used all of them to some extent; some much more than others though.  The Visual Studio Code software was an essential part of the equation when using HTML5 and CSS3 to code the entire website.  Trello was also quite important to enable the tracking of the project questions and answers and the general progress of the work being carried out.  The (slightly) less frequently used software were GitHub, Slack and Terminal.  I am therefore satisfied that all of them did their job satisfactorily and I would definitely enjoy using them all again on future projects.

<h5>
    2.2
</h5>
<h6>
    Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.  E.g., Visual Studio Code, Trello.
</h6>
<p>
    It was very useful to be able to combine the Visual Studio Code windows on to one screen whilst writing, reading through or testing the HTML5 and CSS3 code I needed to write.  I did this via the top menu in VS Code, following the ‘View’, ‘Editor Layout’ and ‘Split Down’ option.  This allowed me to track the coding syntax from both languages in adjacent view windows at a glance or scroll.  I could relate strings of code in both areas and therefore write the code much more easily.  The in-built Terminal feature within VS Code was also great for directing my saved files to GitHub.
    <br><br>
    GitHub proved vital for allowing me to work in the training room during the daytime and on my own MacBook Pro in the evenings at home, although, because I’d never used it before there were a few, ‘teething issues’ ...however, I did overcome these.
    <br><br>
    Trello was something I was much more familiar with, as I’ve used it for my own personal projects in the past.
    <br><br>
    I have been a general Apple & Mac user for over 12 years now and I’m extremely satisfied that I have valuable long-term experience when using all types of Apple products; I’ve even worked for Apple in the past as a sales consultant.  I would definitely say that all of the correct (software) tools I needed were at my disposal and I had lots of fun using them, despite the challenges they occasionally presented me with.

    Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project.  Are you happy with your website?  Why?  Why not?  You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness.  What would you change?
