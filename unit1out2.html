    Outcome 2:
</h4>
<ul> 
    <li>Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Now you have setup your blog, it’s time to get into the detail.  You now need to critically review your website.  To the bottom of your website add a review section that contains the following information.</li>
</ul>
    </div>
    <div>
<h5>
    2.1
</h5>
<h6>
    Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed.  In making your own website are you happy with the tools you used?  E.g., Visual Studio Code, Trello.
</h6>
<p>
    I’m coming to the stage where my website feels almost complete (for the purpose of the project requirements at least) and in review of the IT tools I have used during the building of it, I can safely say I have made good use of all of them to some extent; some much more than others though.  The Visual Studio Code software was an essential part of the equation when using HTML5 and CSS3 to code the entire website.
    <br><br>
    Trello was also quite important to enable the tracking of the project questions and answers and overview the general progress of the work being carried out.
    <br><br>
    The (slightly) less frequently used software were GitHub, Slack and Terminal.  However, I would say that I am very satisfied that they all did their job well and I’d definitely enjoy using them all again on future projects, now that I have acclimatised to their behaviours and facilities.
</p>
    </div>

<h5>
    2.2
</h5>
<h6>
    Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.  E.g., Visual Studio Code, Trello.
</h6>
<p>
    It was very useful to be able to combine the Visual Studio Code windows on to one screen whilst writing, reading through or testing the HTML5 and CSS3 code I needed to write.  I did this via the top menu in VS Code, following the ‘View’ then, ‘Editor Layout’ and ‘Split Down’ option.  This allowed me to track the coding syntax from both languages in adjacent view windows at a scroll and/or glance.  I could relate strings of code in both areas and therefore write the code much more easily.  The in-built Terminal feature within VS Code was also great for directing my saved files to GitHub.
    <br><br>
    GitHub proved vital by allowing me to work in the training room during the daytime and at home on my own MacBook Pro in the evenings, although, because I’d never used it before there were a few, ‘teething issues’ ...however, I did overcome these.
    <br><br>
    Trello was something I was much more familiar with, as I’ve used it for my own personal projects in the past.
    <br><br>
    I have been a general Apple & Mac user for over 12 years now and I’m extremely satisfied that I have valuable, long-term experience when using all types of Apple products.  I’ve even worked for Apple in the past as a sales consultant.  I would definitely say that all of the correct (software) tools I needed were at my disposal and I had plenty of fun challenging myself whilst using them; despite the difficulties they occasionally presented me with.

    Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project.  Are you happy with your website?  Why?  Why not?  You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness.  What would you change?
</h6>
<p>
    Overall, I am really proud of the website I’ve created.  I tried my upmost to get the very best out of the experience, so as to give me a good grounding on which to build other websites in the future.  I feel as though I’ve achieved the project brief that was set for us.
    <br><br>
    My website may seem relatively primitive in its code development and aesthetic appearance compared to a professionally built website, but I won’t be too hard on myself, because this is the first website I’ve ever built from scratch using nothing more than coding as the fundamental architecture.  Previously, I have only been used to using drop & drag website templates provided by facilities like that of Squarespace.  This is therefore a huge step forwards in my learning curve and I’m very pleased with the outcome.
    <br><br>
    I was able to research less obvious strings of code that I wished to implement in to my own website via external coding resources like, w3schools.com and stackoverflow.com; this helped me achieve the functionality and appearance I was looking for.
    <br><br>
    With being somewhat a self-confessed perfectionist, I found my biggest weakness was trying to spend more time on the website than was necessary or allowed for… when you realise the endless possibilities available, it becomes so unbelievably tempting though!  This is something I would most definitely rein in considerably, once in a less academic scenario.  I’m convinced this was only due to my desire to explore the many coding options I had got at my disposal.
    <br><br>
    I would find it much easier to build a website from scratch upon a second attempt, now that I have learnt the basis skills required to do so and therefore this would speed up my workflow exponentially next time around.

    Describe further improvements you can make to your project.
</h6>
<p>
    I selected a font-family (Courier New), my heading-sizes and a hexadecimal colour referencing palette to use throughout this web-build project.  It was extremely helpful when trying to assist the coding process and keep the appearance consistent across the entire site.  That said, I would potentially revise the colour scheme I used and try to bring a more professional look to my pages if I started all over again.  I would make more use of Trello than I did this time around also.  I found Trello was more of a reference tool for guiding the questions and answers, rather than stemming my usual working patterns and/or style as much, on this occasion.  I would of course like to have had much more time to add in extra features like; drop down menu buttons, I’d maybe reposition the website navigation area to be at the top (although, I do like the way it is set out) and I’d really like to make my site much more user interactive and accessible, given the time.
</p>
    </div>
<p>The following image shows a screenshot of the colour palette (hexadecimal codes) and heading sizes that I kept locally available to myself whilst building my website.  This helped considerably with keeping the consistency of the appearance throughout my webpages and although I made a few subtle changes to this palette (e.g., the white panels behind lighter text became a more suitable blue gradient panel with black text instead) the majority of it very much applies:</p>
    <div class="containertwo">

    Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.
</h6>
<p>
    I have reviewed the outcomes and I believe I have matched them with suitable answers on each occasion.  I could’ve perhaps extended on a few of my answers, but in honesty, I didn’t think I’d done any injustice to the project with the responses I’ve given.  As required within the project brief we were set, I have also included at least one example of a ‘class’ and an ‘id’ inside my coding, therefore I am content that my submission is fully fit for purpose.
